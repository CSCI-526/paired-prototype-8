- Description of Prototype:
    > Mag Runner is a 2D-platformer game where players switch magnetic polarity to find a way out of a maze made of magnets. As the player, the goal is to reach the specific end platform. Unlike ordinary 2D-platformer games, players are not allowed to move with arrow keys and jump between platforms with space key. Instead, players need to change their magnetic polarity to attach to or repel from moving magnetic platforms in the map to move around. 

- Controls:
    Movement & Jump: “N”- Switch to North, “S” - Switch to South
